This is a program that will solve a rubik's cube.
First, a picture of the cube will be inputted and it will be processed by visual.py
Then, the resulting matrix will be sent to matrix.py, where it will be numbered and organized.
After that, it is sent to solver.py where it is solved by an algorithm and will be sent to cube.py
Cube.py houses the upper level functions for movement, while motors.py houses the lower level motor movement functions.
